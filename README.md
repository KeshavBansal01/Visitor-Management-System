# üè¢ Visitor Management System

A simple **web application** for managing visitor check-ins and check-outs with SMS and Email notifications to the host. Designed for offices, events, or any place where visitor tracking is essential.

---

## üìñ Introduction
The application provides two main options: **Check-In** and **Check-Out**.

1. **Check-In**
   - Visitor enters their own details along with the host's details.
   - An SMS and email are sent to the host containing the visitor's information.

2. **Check-Out**
   - Visitor enters their registered email ID for verification.
   - Upon verification, the visitor is checked out of the system.

---

## üîÑ Workflow
1. Visitor chooses **Check-In**.
2. Fills in:
   - **Visitor Details** (Name, Email, Phone)
   - **Host Details** (Name, Email, Phone)
3. Visitor may later choose **Check-Out**.
4. Enters their **email ID** for verification.
5. After verification, the system checks them out.
6. Visitors can check in and out independently of other visitors.

## üóÑ Database Structure
The database `user` has **three collections** to avoid redundancy:
### Clients
| Field  | Description       |
|--------|-------------------|
| name   | Visitor Name       |
| email  | Visitor Email      |
| phone  | Visitor Phone      |

### Hosts
| Field  | Description       |
|--------|-------------------|
| hname  | Host Name          |
| hemail | Host Email         |
| hphone | Host Phone         |

### Visits
| Field    | Description         |
|----------|---------------------|
| email    | Visitor Email        |
| checkin  | Check-In Timestamp   |
| checkout | Check-Out Timestamp  |
| hemail   | Host Email           |



I have made 3 collections so as to reduce redundancy in the database. Even if a visitor has visited the office more than once, his details will only be stored once in the Clients collection. The same goes for the Host's Details.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Corner Cases
1. A visitor **cannot check in** again without first checking out.
2. A visitor **cannot check out** with an email ID that was never used for check-in.
3. A visitor **cannot check out** twice.
